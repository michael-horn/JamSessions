<div class="help-summary">
  Play a note with a pitch value greater than 0. You can also
  call <span class="help-param-name">playNote</span> with a list of
  notes that will be played at the same time. The optional parameter
  <span class="help-param-name">beats</span> sets how long the will note last,
  and the optional parameter <span class="help-param-name">velocity</span> sets
  how hard/loud the will note sounds. Velocity can be any number between 0 and 127.

<h3 class="help-function-name">playSound(sound, beats = 1.0, pitch = 0, velocity = 100)</h3>
<div class="help-summary">
  Play a custom sound using its ID number. You can also
  call <span class="help-param-name">playSound</span> with a list of
  sounds that will be played at the same time. The optional parameter
  <span class="help-param-name">beats</span> sets how long the will note last,

  how hard/loud the will note sounds. Velocity can be any number between 0 and 127.
  The optional <span class="help-param-name">pitch</span> parameter changes the
  pitch of the sound by the given number of semi-tones. For example, a pitch value of
  3.0 would be the same as the difference from a C to a D&sharp; on the piano keyboard.

<h3 class="help-function-name">with bend(cents = 0, beats = -1, start = 0):</h3>
<div class="help-summary">
  Adds a pitch bend effect that changes the value of notes over time.
  The <span class="help-param-name">cents</span> parameter represents the total
  change in pitch. One cent is equal to 1/100 of a semitone (the distance between
  two adjacent notes). Using a value of 500 for the <span class="help-param-name">cents</span>
  parameter would bend the note by five semitones (the same as the distance from a C to an F
  on the piano keyboard). The <span class="help-param-name">beats</span> parameter specifies
  how long it takes for the note to bend. If you don't provide the <span class="help-param-name">beats</span>
  parameter, the effect will be constant. An optional <span class="help-param-name">start</span>
  parameter specifies how long to wait (in beats) before starting the effect. You can also
  provide an list of values instead of a single number for the
  <span class="help-param-name">cents</span> parameter. These values represent the change
  in cents over time. Each number will be evenly distributed over the duration of the effect.

  If a single number is provided, a constant change in volume will be applied&mdash;there will
  be no change over time. You can also pass a list of numbers to create a change over time.
